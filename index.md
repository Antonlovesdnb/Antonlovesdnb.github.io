## Hunting Malicious Macros<a name="first"></a>

Taking a look at the MITRE ATT&CK page for malicious macros, it's clear that this technique is a favourite among APT groups. Microsoft Office is ubiquitous in a corporate office setting and presents defenders with a very large attack surface. 

"Just disable macros" is a great idea, but many critical business processes run on the back of decades-old macros, for better or for worse.

This is some example Code:

```powershell
Write-Host "Hello World"
```

Languages I don't like:

1. Python
2. Python
3. Python

Why I don't like Python:

* I suck at it
* Bad IDE
* I suck at it

Code syntax highlight test:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}
